## Why rollyourown? Why collaborate?

We aim to lower the barrier to using great, open source projects by making the deployment and use of open source software easy for everyone.

The [open source community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) is amazing and has produced high-quality, free open source software for anyone to use, but the barrier to configuring and deploying open source software for real-world use is too high. While downloading and starting an open source software application is quite easy, integrating it with other open source applications and finding a good and secure configuration for a working service is not.

For open source to scale up and reach more users, we need more than open source software. **We need free and open source automated deployment**.

Automated deployments, with [Immutable Infrastructure](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-mutable-vs-immutable-infrastructure) and configuration and infrastructure in code make system integration fast, repeatable and manageable.

With rollyourown, we aim to make system integration a collaborative, open source activity. A canonical, working configuration for deploying any open source application or combination of open source applications can be developed collaboratively as code and this code made available for anyone to use. A working configuration can be deployed in minutes and is repeatable over any number of deployments.

That's how we lower the barrier to using open source applications.
