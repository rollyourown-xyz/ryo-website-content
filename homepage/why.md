## Why rollyourown? Why collaborate?

We aim to lower the barrier to using great, open source projects by making the deployment and use of open source software easy for everyone.

The [open source community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) is amazing and has produced high-quality, free open source software for anyone to use, but the barrier to configuring and deploying open source software for real-world use is too high. While downloading and starting an open source software application is quite easy, integrating it with other open source applications and finding a good and secure configuration for a working service is not.

For open source to scale up and reach more users, we need more than open source software. **We need free and open source automated deployment**.
