We operate a Matrix homeserver for communication within the rollyourown project organisation and to host public rooms for discussion of projects, modules and the website.

<!--more-->

To participate in discussion in our public rooms, you will need an account in the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) ecosystem. The ideal way to join the ecosystem is to [run your own homseserver](/rollyourown/projects/ryo-matrix/). Alternatively, you can create an account on a [public homeserver](https://joinmatrix.org/servers/) or use a [hosted homeserver](https://matrix.org/hosting/).

## Our public rooms

The public rooms hosted on our Matrix homeserver are as follows:

{{< table tableclass="table table-bordered table-striped" theadclass="table-primary" >}}

| Room name | Purpose | Room address(es) |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- |
| News & Announcements | News and announcements for the rollyourown project and website | #news:rollyourown.xyz, #announcements:rollyourown.xyz |
| General Discussion | General discussion about the rollyourown project and website | #general:rollyourown.xyz |
| Collaboration | Discussions about collaborating on the rollyourown project | #collaboration:rollyourown.xyz |
| Technical Discussion | Technical discussions about rollyourown projects and modules | #technical:rollyourown.xyz |

{{< /table >}}

As the project grows, we plan to add additional public rooms to discuss individual projects and modules.

## How to join the discussion

From your [Matrix client of choice](https://matrix.org/clients/), join a room directly using the room address shown in the table above.

Alternatively, if your client supports it, you can browse public rooms on the rollyourown homeserver and join from the published list of rooms.
