## Join the discussion in our public Matrix rooms

We operate a Matrix homeserver for communication within the rollyourown.xyz project organisation and host public rooms for discussion of projects, modules and the website.

To participate in discussion in our public rooms, you will need an account in the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) ecosystem. The ideal way to join the ecosystem is to [run your own homseserver](/rollyourown/projects/single_server_projects/ryo-matrix/). Alternatively, you can create an account on a public homeserver such as the one [operated by the Matrix organisation](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now) or one of [various others](https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php) or use a [hosted homeserver](https://matrix.org/hosting/).
