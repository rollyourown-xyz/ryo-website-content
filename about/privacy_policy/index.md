Our policy is to collect as little personal data as necessary in providing this website and in providing the services we offer to members of our organisation.

<!--more-->

The controller mentioned below (“we”), operates the website ”rollyourown” (the “Platform" or the “Site”), accessible at [https://rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) and related subdomains. With this privacy policy, we inform you about the personal data we collect when you visit our Site and how we process it. Thereby, we also fulfil our obligation to inform you pursuant to Article 13 [General Data Protection Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) (GDPR).

Although this Privacy Policy is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), as is the majority of the content of this website, the policy has been formulated specifically for our project and the infrastructure we provide (the "Project"). This policy is therefore not universally valid and changes will need to be made if the text of this policy is used for other purposes.

## Purposes of processing, its legal basis and the period for which the data will be stored

### General use of the Site

Generally, we do not store personal data while you use our Site with the exception that our webserver registers all connections to the Site automatically and collects the following technical information about your visit:

- IP address
- Name of the files accessed
- Information about the transmission
- Date and time of the connection
- Amount of data transmitted
- Operating system and
- Web browser/ user agent

We process this data to establish a connection to your device over the Internet. We store the aforementioned data in log files in order to ensure the security and integrity of our systems. The respective purposes of the processing also constitute the legitimate interests we pursue with it (Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) GDPR). We retain our log files for 14 days and delete them thereafter.

### Contact

You can contact us, for example, by sending us an e-mail or by using our contact forms. In such cases, we will process the personal data you provide us with in order to answer your request. This may include in particular your name, e-mail address, the subject of your message and the message itself.

We will retain your messages until we have fulfilled your request. After that, we will delete them immediately unless legal provisions prevent deletion.

Where the GDPR applies, we may store data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR where necessary for the purpose of providing evidence or to comply with legal retention periods in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c) GDPR.

If your request is made within the framework of an existing or prospective contractual relationship with us, the storage period shall be based on the underlying contractual relationship.

We base the processing for such purposes on Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) GDPR, while the purposes of the processing also constitute the legitimate interests we pursue with it.

### Registration on the Platform

Members of our organisation are provided with an account on our Git repository server. This account is used to access our repository server as well as provide authorisation for accessing our non-public development website and our collaboration tools.

For this purpose, we will ask you for an e-mail address and a username.  We will issue an initial password during registration, which you will change on first login. We will use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation e-mail to validate your e-mail address and account. If not validated, your account will be deleted after 14 days. If you validate your account by logging in, your account will be active until you delete it, by using the functions of the platform, or request us to delete it for you.

The legal basis for the processing described above is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.

When you use our services we will collect certain information from you (if you provide it) and associate it with your account, such as:

- your password for our Git repository server and our other platforms
- your language preference (optional),
- your legal name (optional),
- one or more of your other e-mail addresses (optional),
- a short biography text (optional),
- a link to your personal website (optional),
- your location (optional, no location tracking),
- your avatar (optional),
- your public SSH key (optional),
- your GPG key (optional),
- your IP address,

and, if you use our Matrix communications platform,

- your display name (optional),
- an e-mail address for notifications (optional),
- your phone number (optional),
- chat contents, including pictures and other content (optional: end-to-end encryption).

If you choose to grant access to an external application or service in order to authorise that application against your account, then authorisation tokens will be shared with that external service according to the OAuth2 standard. We store information on which external applications you granted access to and associate it with your account until you revoke access to the external application or service. We process this information to provide you with this authentication feature.

The legal basis for the processing described above is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.

We generally process your personal data for as long as you have an account with us and delete it afterwards.

### Services associated with the Project

Throughout the Project, we offer you a range of services for which we process certain personal data.

#### Use of the website

You can read our website without giving us any personal data. However, if you wish to contact us or provide feedback using the contact forms (such as the [general contact form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/contact-us), the [data protection contact form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/data-protection), the [security vulnerability contact form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/security-vulnerability), the [translation contact form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/translation), or the [join us form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/join-us)) we will handle your data as stated in [Section 2.2](#contact).

#### Collaboration: Our Git repository server

Should you choose to collaborate with us as a member of our organisation (for example to be a maintainer of one or more of our repositories), then you may contribute to the Project using our [Git repository server](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/). In this case, we display your username next to all of your contributions such as code commits, raised issues, comments and other contents.

If you choose to delete your account, then you will also delete your personal repositories or transfer them to the ownership of another user’s account. Any contributions (such as Issues, code commits, comments or Pull Requests) that you have made in repositories owned by other accounts will not be deleted. Your username in Issues, comments and Pull Requests will be replaced with the word “Ghost”. Your username in code commits in repository histories will not be changed. This serves to ensure the integrity of the commits and is inherent to the way Git repositories work.

Where the GDPR applies, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit b) GDPR. In case you delete your account, we will retain your contributions as stated above based on our legitimate interest of a consistent git repository according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.

#### Collaboration: Other Git repository servers

We maintain mirrors of our public repositories [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/rollyourown-xyz) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz) and you may also collaborate with us using your pre-existing account on those platforms. When you collaborate with us on those platforms, you do so subject to those platforms' privacy policies.

#### Collaboration: Matrix

For collaboration purposes, we provide a [Matrix](https://matrix.org) communication system which our organisation members can access using their Git repository account.

If you use the Matrix communication services we provide, by logging in with your Git repository account, we process your personal data to provide you with the Matrix functions.

Where the GDPR applies, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. We store the conversations for a proper documentation based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. You can choose to use end-to-end encryption in personal 1-1 and group chats, in which case we will not be able to read the contents of your communication.

If you request a deactivation of your Matrix account, your personal information will be deleted from our system.

You may send messages to other Matrix system users. As a federated communication system, the recipients of your messages may be other users of our Matrix system or users of other Matrix systems that are federated with our system. As with other communications systems such as e-mail or SMS, messages you have sent and that have been received by other users are not deleted from those recipient users’ accounts when your account is deleted.

While data storage and processing on our Matrix system is covered by this policy, this policy cannot apply to data storage and processing on other federated systems outside our control. The Matrix protocol is a federated communications protocol and anyone, anywhere in the world may run a Matrix homeserver. If you choose to communicate with users of other Matrix systems, then your data will be processed by systems outside our responsibility and according to the privacy policies of those systems’ operators. This is an inherent property of a federated communication system.

In order to use and interact with our Matrix system, you will use client software. As an open protocol, there are many clients that may be used with our servers, for example those listed on [https://matrix.org/clients/](https://matrix.org/clients/). Our organisation is not responsible for the data stored and processed by any client software provided by other parties. Matrix clients typically store the user’s data locally on the device on which the client is running (for example, the laptop from which the user accesses a web-based client or the smartphone on which the user installs a client app). This is also the case for the Element web-based Matrix client that we host at [https://element.rollyourown.xyz/](https://element.rollyourown.xyz/).

### Donations

We may, in future, implement ways for users to sponsor or donate to the Project – for example to help fund the running costs of our services. If and when we do this, we will update this page with information about privacy and data-protections aspects.

## Storage Period

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we will process and store your personal data for as long as it is required for the respective purpose and delete it thereafter.

## Categories of Recipients

We use external service providers if we are unable to provide services ourselves or if it is not reasonable to do so. These external service providers are primarily providers of IT services, such as our hosting service provider [netcup](https://www.netcup.de/) (netcup GmbH, Daimlerstraße 25, D-76185 Karlsruhe) and our domain hosting and e-mail provider [STRATO](https://www.strato.de/) (STRATO AG, Otto-Ostrowski-Straße 7, D-10249 Berlin).

## General Rights of Data Subjects

The GDPR guarantees you certain rights, which you can assert against us -- if the legal requirements are met:

- **Art. 15 GDPR - Right of access**: You have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether personal data relating to you are being processed and, if so, what these data are and the detailed circumstances of the processing.

- **Art. 16 GDPR - Right of rectification**: You have the right to ask us to immediately rectify incorrect personal data concerning you. You also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data, including by means of a supplementary declaration, taking into account the purposes of the processing.

- **Art. 17 GDPR - Right to deletion**: You have the right to demand that we delete any personal data relating to you immediately.

- **Art. 18 GDPR - Right to restriction of processing**: You have the right to request us to restrict processing.

- **Art. 20 GDPR - Right to data portability**: You have the right, in the event of processing based on consent or for the fulfilment of a contract, to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided us with, in a structured, common and machine-readable format and to transfer this data to another responsible party without hindrance from us or to have the data transferred directly to the other responsible party, insofar as this is technically feasible.

- **Art. 77 GDPR in conjunction with Section 19 BDSG - Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority**: You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority at any time, in particular in the Member State in which you are resident, in which your place of work is located, or which is the place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes data protection law.

## Right to object and right to withdraw consent

- **Art. 21 GDPR - Right to object**: You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is necessary on the basis of a legitimate interest on our part or in order to carry out a task in the public interest, or which is carried out in the exercise of official authority.

  If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

  If we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to the processing at any time. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.

  In order to exercise your right of objection, you can, for example, send us an e-mail to the e-mail address mentioned above.

- **Art. 7 GDPR - Withdrawal of consent**: If you have given us your informed consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. In this case, all data processing that we have carried out until your withdrawal remains lawful.

## Obligation to provide data

You have no contractual or legal obligation to provide us with personal data. However, we then might not be able to offer you the requested services.

## The existence of automated decision-making (including profiling)

We will not make you subject to any automated decision-making, including profiling in accordance with Art. 22 para. 1 and 4 GDPR, which has legal effects on you or affects you.

## Internet-specific Data Processing and Cookies

We may store and access information on your end device if it is necessary to provide you with our services. In any other case we will ask for your informed consent.
