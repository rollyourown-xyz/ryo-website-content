## Notice regarding content

The free and publicly-available content on this website has been created with a high level of diligence. Despite this, the publisher provides no guarantee of the correctness or currentness of any freely-provided and publicly-available journalistic advice or information. Content for which an author is mentioned by name reflects the opinion of the author and not necessarily the opinion of the website publisher. No contractual obligation arises between the user and publisher of the website from accessing the free and publicly-available content, to the extent that the publisher does not intend any legal relations to arise.

## External Links

This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are within the responsibility of the respective operator. At the time of including these links on this website, the publisher has checked the external content for statutory violations. No statutory violations were evident at that point in time. The publisher has no influence on the current of future layout or content of the linked web pages. Adding an external link or reference does not mean that the publisher assumes responsibility for the linked or referenced content. Without direct evidence of statutory violations, a continual or regular monitoring of external links is not reasonable for the publisher. However, in case the publisher is made aware of statutory violations, then such external links will be removed without delay.
