Our aim is to make **deploying and using** [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software easy. We do this so that more people can deploy and use de-centralised and federated systems, to keep their data and communications private and under their own control.

We do this by **lowering the barrier** to using great, open source projects. An open source and community-developed collection of automated infrastructure deployment code is provided, that anyone can use. Within a few minutes, our automation code builds and deploys integrated, working and maintainable end-to-end **solutions** with a good, usable and secure configuration.

## Our aims

The open source community is amazing. Myriad, high-quality software applications have been developed by the open source community and made available for everyone to use for free. For nearly every [centralised, proprietary, privacy-invading internet service that surveils and mines users' private data for profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism), there is an open source alternative that respects privacy, rejects surveillance and leaves the user in control of their own data and how it is used.

**Deploying and using** open source software should be easy so that more people can use free, de-centralised and federated systems to keep their data and communications private and under their own control.

Our aim is to promote open source software and stimulate its proliferation. We aim to make it easy to deploy and run end-to-end solutions based on open source applications. For every open source internet solution, we hope there can be a [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) project to deploy it. Deployment of working and usable solutions should be as easy as `./deploy.sh -n servername` and maintenance as easy as `upgrade.sh -n servername`.

## Our beliefs and the problem we address

The internet has been transformational and enabled people to build communities, share knowledge and do great things. A significant amount of the technology making the modern internet run has been developed in the open by communities of developers, working for free and publishing their work under an open source license for anyone to use. Just a few examples of great open source projects are the ones we use to [power rollyourown.xyz](/about/credits/).

However, the internet services that people actually use have been monopolised by profit-oriented companies. These companies have taken community-developed applications, added reasonable online front-ends, made them free of charge to the end-user (but financed via the exploitation of those users' data), removed interoperability and federation to lock users to their service, and essentially centralised a decentral system.

While most users of these services are either unaware of this or don't care, many users feel uncomfortable about the invasion of privacy and exploitation of data carried out by modern internet behemoths. Most, however, don't know there is an alternative or, if they do, how to deploy it. For pretty much any centralised, profit-oriented, privacy-invading service hoarding and mining its users' data, there is an open-source, federated alternative which keeps data and privacy intact and works just as well.

The main problem preventing the adoption of open-source software by a wider community, other than not knowing about the alternatives, are the barriers to configuring and deploying it. While downloading and starting a single open source software application is quite easy, it is not so easy to integrate it with other open source applications and find a good and secure configuration to create a working service.

To take open source software and actually use it, a solution builder needs time, patience and experience:

- Time and patience to dig into the documentation, experience to interpret it, to understand how a component works and to figure out how to integrate it with other components
- Time and experience to filter through blog posts, websites and forum posts to find the reason why something isn't working as expected and a hint for how to fix it
- Time, patience and experience to develop a good, end-to-end configuration and to set up the software to run securely and reliably
- Time and experience to deploy and later maintain a working system

With time and patience, technically experienced developers and system builders can install, integrate and configure open source applications to provide usable and reliable services and maintain them over time as software is upgraded and bugs are fixed.

However, the time and experience needed to do this does not scale to be able to provide these services to a wider community. A single developer or system builder may have enjoyed the process of getting a solution to work for themselves, but is unlikely to want to repeat the process over and over again for friends and family.

Combined with the (lack of) [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) and [bandwagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect) effects, this prevents the proliferation of free and open source applications beyond a niche, technically-skilled and committed community.

Free and open source software is in itself not enough for large numbers of (especially non-technical) users to take control of their own data and communications. Free and open source software needs to be configured, integrated and deployed to provide a working and reliable system. For open source to scale up, we need free and open source **automated deployments**.

## Our approach

By automating the configuration and deployment of open source software applications, we make configuration and integration repeatable. We provide open source **end-to-end solutions** that are themselves developed in the open, with the results made available for anyone to use.

The open source model of development has proven to be a great way to organise collaboration on community software projects. A repository-based collaboration model, as used today mostly for software development, can actually be used to organise almost any project. This includes the development of automation code to configure and deploy end-to-end solutions. This automation code can also be version controlled and collaboratively developed.

By publishing our automation code as open source, experienced developers and system builders who develop good, working solutions for themselves can provide their solutions to the community in a re-usable way. Other developers and system builders can then improve these solutions, contributing their improvements back to the community via our open source projects.

If the configuration and deployment of open source software is automated and the automation code is freely available, then:

- More people can deploy open source solutions, without themselves needing to invest the time and/or have the experience to solve integration problems and get things working
- Developers and system builders can deploy open source solutions for many, many more friends and family, as the time needed to deploy and maintain a solution is hugely reduced

By providing freely-available automation code to deploy open source solutions, we **lower the barrier** to using great, open source projects. Our automation code can be used to build and deploy integrated, working, secure and maintainable end-to-end **solutions** within a few minutes.
