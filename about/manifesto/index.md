Our aim is to make **deploying and using** [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software easy so that more people can roll their own (i.e. deploy and use) free, de-centralised and federated systems to keep their data and communications private and under their own control.

We do this by **lowering the barrier** to using great, open source projects. We provide an open source and community developed collection of automated infrastructure deployment code, that anyone can use, that builds and deploys integrated, working and maintainable end-to-end **solutions** within a few minutes with a good, usable and secure configuration.

## Our aims

The open source community is amazing. Myriad high-quality software has been developed by communities of developers and made available to everyone to use for free. For nearly every [centralised, proprietary, privacy-invading internet service that surveils and mines their users' private data for profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism), there is an open source alternative that respects privacy, rejects surveillance and leaves the user in control of their own data and how it is used.

**Deploying and using** open source software should be easy so that more people can use free, de-centralised and federated systems to keep their data and communications private and under their own control.

Our aim is to help open source software proliferate by making it easy to deploy and run end-to-end solutions based on open source applications. For every open source internet application, we hope there can be a [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) project to deploy it. Deployment of working and usable solutions should be as easy as `./deploy.sh -n servername` and maintenance as easy as `upgrade.sh -n servername`.

## Our beliefs and the problem we address

The internet has been transformational and enabled people to build communities, share knowledge and do great things. A huge amount of the technology that makes the modern internet run has been developed in the open by communities of developers, working for free and publishing their work as open source for anyone to use. Just a few examples of open source projects are the ones we use to [power rollyourown.xyz](/about/credits/).

The internet services that people actually use have, however, been monopolised by profit-oriented companies. These companies have taken community-developed applications, added good online front-ends, made them free to the end-user (but financed via the exploitation of those users' data), removed interoperability and federation to lock users to the service and essentially centralised a decentral system.

While most users of these services are either unaware of this, or don't care, many users feel uncomfortable about the invasion of privacy and exploitation of data carried out by modern internet behemoths. Most, however, don't know there is an alternative. For pretty much any centralised, profit-oriented, privacy-invading service hoarding and mining its users' data, there is an open-source, federated alternative which keeps data and privacy intact and works just as well.

The main problem, other than not knowing about it, that prevents the adoption of open-source software by a wider community are the barriers to configuring and deploying it. While downloading and starting a single open source software application is quite easy, configuring it and integrating it with other open source applications to have a working service, with a good and secure configuration, is not so easy.

To take open source software and actually use it, a solution builder needs time and experience. Time to dig into the documentation to understand how the component works and how to integrate it with other components. Time and experience to develop a good end-to-end configuration and to set up the software to run securely and reliably. Time and experience to deploy and later maintain a system.

While technically experienced developers and system builders can, with time and patience, install, integrate and configure open source applications to provide usable and reliable services, maintaining them over time as software is upgraded and bugs are fixed, the experience and time needed to do this does not scale to be able to provide these services to a wider community. Combined with the (lack of) [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) and [bandwagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect) effects, this prevents the proliferation of free and open source applications beyond a niche, technically-skilled and committed community.

Free or open source software is not enough for users to take control of their own data and communications - free and open source software needs to be configured, integrated and deployed to provide a working system.

## Our approach

By automating the configuration and deployment of open source software applications, making configuration and integration repeatable, we provide open source **end-to-end solutions** that are themselves developed in the open, with the results made available for anyone to use.

The open source model of development has proven to be a great way to organise collaboration on community software projects. A repository-based collaboration model, as used today mostly for software development, can actually be used to organise almost any project. This includes the development of automation code to configure and deploy end-to-end solutions consisting of integrated open source applications. This automation code can also be version controlled and collaboratively developed.

By publishing our automation code as open source, experienced developers and system builders who develop good, working solutions for themselves can provide their solutions to the community in a re-usable way. Other developers and system builders can then improve these solutions, contributing their improvements back to the community via our open source projects.

If the configuration and deployment of open source software is automated and freely available, then anyone can deploy it, without themselves needing to be a developer or system builder with the experience and time available to solve integration problems and get things working. By providing freely-available automation code to deploy open source solutions, we **lower the barrier** to using great, open source projects. Our automation code can be used to build and deploy integrated, working, secure and maintainable end-to-end **solutions** within a few minutes.
