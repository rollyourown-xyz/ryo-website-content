## Technical FAQs

E.g.:

- Why Ubuntu? Why not Debian, Fedora, Arch, Alpine, ...? - We standardize on one platform. Why not Ubuntu as one of the most popular and likely to be available at every hosting provider? Also, for containers, ubuntu-minimal available as a base image.

- Why don't you use Docker? Commercial company, Docker Hub goes against rolling your own, ...

- But isn't Canonical a commercial company too - yes, but...

- Why use Atom editor in your example? Why not VSCode, vi, ... - Atom is one of the more user-friendly editors with git integration and therefore more suitable for non-technical, non-developers to use than a fully-featured editor. If you are technical / advanced enough to have a different preference, you are likely to be able to install and use it already (and probably already do)
