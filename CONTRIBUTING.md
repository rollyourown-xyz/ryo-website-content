# Contributing

Thank you for taking an interest in collaborating with us on the [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) project and website!

Your collaboration on improving, translating or extending our website will be much appreciated.

## How to contribute

We would be delighted if you would like to contribute and there are a number of ways you can collaborate on the content of the website.

### Suggesting changes

The easiest way to contribute to our website is to suggest an improvement or tell us about typos, bad phrasing etc. This can be done via the [Issues](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-content/issues). Before submitting an issue, please search the existing issues in case the topic has already been addressed.

In your issue, please provide a link to the [website](https://rollyourown.xyz) page on which you are providing feedback or, ideally, a link to the content in our repository.

### Making small changes

If you would like to submit smaller changes yourself (e.g. correcting typos, improving phrasing etc.), then this can be done by forking the repository and submitting a Pull Request. Please follow the workflow described on our website in [our guide to Forking and Pull Requests](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/).

### Making larger or structural changes

If you would like to propose larger changes or suggest structural changes to the website, please first submit an [Issue](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-content/issues) describing what you would like to change and why. The website maintainer can then provide feedback on the proposal in advance of you doing any work. There may be a reason why your proposal would not be accepted, or should be realised differently, so this avoids you doing work which will end up not being accepted and merged

If, after discussing the change, you would like to proceed and implement it, then please fork the GitHub mirror repository and submit a Pull Request. Please follow the workflow described on our website in [our guide to Forking and Pull Requests](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/).

### Translating the website

If you would like to help us translate our website into other languages, please [contact us](https://rollyourown.xyz/about/contact/#website-translation).
