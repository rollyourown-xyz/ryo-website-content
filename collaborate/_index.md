Do you enjoy building solutions with open source software? Would you like to share the results so that others can benefit from your work? Do you want to help open source software proliferate by making solution deployments repeatable and easy?

<!--more-->

Thank you for taking an interest in collaborating with us on the rollyourown.xyz project!

This is the documentation for **collaborating** on rollyourown.xyz projects. You can browse the content via the menu on the left-hand side.

## Lower the barrier

We aim to lower the barrier to using great, open source projects by making the deployment and use of open source software easy for everyone.

For open source to scale up and reach more users [we believe](/about/manifesto/#our-beliefs-and-the-problem-we-address) that, on top of great, open source software, we need free and open source **automated deployments**.

Automated deployments make system integration fast, repeatable and manageable so that open source solutions can be used by anyone. A canonical, working configuration for any open source application (or usually a combination of open source applications) can be developed collaboratively as code and this code made available for anyone to use. A working configuration can be deployed in minutes and is repeatable over any number of deployments.

## Collaborate on Infrastructure Code

rollyourown.xyz is a collaborative open source project. Our projects and modules are developed within [a framework](/collaborate/project_and_module_development/general_architecture/) and all [projects](/rollyourown/projects/) and [modules](/rollyourown/project_modules/) as well as the content of the website itself are developed in the open.

As an experienced developer and system builder, you have invested your time and experience in creating working solutions made of open source components. You have integrated and configured open source applications to provide usable and reliable services. However, the time and experience you have invested does not necessarily scale to help others use the same components.

Collaborate with us to provide your solutions to the community in a re-usable way. Use our framework to create configuration- and infrastructure-as-code to make your solutions repeatable. Work with other developers and system builders to improve these solutions via our open source projects.

Together, we can lower the barrier to using great, open source projects.

## How to collaborate

We would be delighted if you would like to collaborate and there are a number of ways you can contribute to the project.

There are many ways to collaborate, for example:

- [Raising security-related issues](/collaborate/security_vulnerabilities/)
- [Contributing bug reports, feature requests and ideas](/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/)
- [Collaboration on an existing project or module](/collaborate/existing_projects_and_modules/) - e.g. to provide fixes or improvements
- [Contributing a new project or module](/collaborate/new_projects_and_modules/)
- [Contributing to rollyourown.xyz website content](/collaborate/website_content/)
- [Maintaining a rollyourown.xyz repository](/collaborate/working_with_git/what_is_git/#project-maintainer)

Each of these are described in more detail on the pages linked.

Code and content of the rollyourown.xyz project is stored in our [public repositories](/collaborate/repositories/), and collaboration is organised around these. We use the Issue tracking features of our own Git repository servers, [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/rollyourown-xyz) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz) to raise, discuss and track ideas, feature requests and bugs, and we use [git-based workflows](/collaborate/working_with_git/), to manage changes to code and content.

To take part in the general discussion around our project, you can join us in our [public Matrix rooms](/about/public_matrix_rooms).
