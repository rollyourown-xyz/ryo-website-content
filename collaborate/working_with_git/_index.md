We use Git repositories to manage our [project](/rollyourown/projects/) and [module](/rollyourown/project_modules/) [code](/collaborate/project_and_module_development/) as well as the [content of this website](/collaborate/website_development/).

<!--more-->

As our projects are open source, we would love it if you would like to [collaborate with us](/collaborate/). To contribute code or content, you will need to work with Git. This section provides:

- An overview of [what Git is and how we use it](/collaborate/working_with_git/what_is_git/) for collaboration
- An overview of how to [fork a repository and submit a Pull Request](/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/) to submit your changes
- An overview of how we [review submitted changes and merge them](/collaborate/working_with_git/reviewing_and_merging/) into our project content
