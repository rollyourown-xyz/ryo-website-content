Our projects and modules have a defined structure, and we want every rollyourown.xyz project and module to be structured in the same way to achieve maximum re-usability.

<!--more-->

The basic structure is provided by the project and module template repositories, which can be forked to form the basis of a new rollyourown.xyz project or module.

This section contains:

- An overview of the [general architecture of projects and modules](/collaborate/project_and_module_development/general_architecture/)
- A reference for the [basic structure of a rollyourown.xyz project](/collaborate/project_and_module_development/project_structure/)
- A reference for the [basic structure of a rollyourown.xyz module](/collaborate/project_and_module_development/module_structure/)
