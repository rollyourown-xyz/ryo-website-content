This section describes how to inform us about security vulnerabilities you may have found anywhere in the rollyourown project.

## Security disclosure policy

Your ethical disclosure of any security vulnerability will be highly appreciated and we ask you to follow the practice of [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) when raising potential security vulnerabilities in rollyourown services, projects or modules.

We will respond to reports of security vulnerabilities with priority and fix the vulnerability as soon as possible. As we are an open source project and not a commercial operation, please take into account that we may need some time to resolve an issue. Please do not disclose a vulnerability publicly without first discussing this with us.

After you have raised a security vulnerability, we will review your report and verify the vulnerability. We will respond with a confirmation and may request further information. Once we have resolved the issue, we will update our code, publish a new version and inform our community. We will also notify you so that you can disclose the vulnerability publicly if desired.

We are currently not in a position to provide bug bounties. If this changes in future, then we will update this page.

## Security vulnerabilities in our services, projects or modules

If you have found a security vulnerability in any rollyourown service or any of the rollyourown projects, modules or other repositories, please report this via our [security vulnerability report form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/security-vulnerability).

## Security issues in software deployed by our projects

We are not the developers of the open source software deployed by rollyourown projects and cannot ourselves address security issues in deployed software. Security issues in deployed software should be reported directly to the applicable open source project. Links to the homepages of the software deployed can be found in the "Software deployed" section on each of the [project](/rollyourown/projects/) or [module](/rollyourown/project_modules/) pages.

If in doubt, or if you have found no way to report a security issue confidentially in these cases, please contact us via our [security vulnerability report form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/security-vulnerability).
