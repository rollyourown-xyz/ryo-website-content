rollyourown promotes the practical use of free and open source software. We [provide](/rollyourown/) code to automatically [configure, build, deploy](/rollyourown/how_to_use/deploy/), [maintain](/rollyourown/how_to_use/maintain/), [back up and restore](/rollyourown/how_to_use/back_up_and_restore/) open source software services. Our goal is to make deployments repeatable and manageable, and make it easy to roll your own.

rollyourown is itself an open source project. Our automation code is managed in public repositories hosted on our [own Git repository server](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/) and mirrored to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/rollyourown-xyz) and [GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz).
