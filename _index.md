## Use open source automation code to roll your own free, de-centralised and federated services

### Keep your data, communications and services private and under your own control

rollyourown.xyz promotes the _practical_ use of free and open source software. We [provide](/rollyourown/) code to automatically [configure, build, deploy](/rollyourown/how_to_use/deploy/), [maintain](/rollyourown/how_to_use/maintain/), [back up and restore](/rollyourown/how_to_use/back_up_and_restore/) services based on open source software. Our goal is to make it easy to roll your own.
