## Raising security issues in rollyourown.xyz services or any of the rollyourown.xyz projects or modules

TODO Notes:

- Mention the service directly provided - anything behind the rollyourown.xyz domain or a subdomain
- Give examples: Git server, Matrix homeserver, Matrix web client, ...

Please report these issues to [security@rollyourown.xyz](mailto:security@rollyourown.xyz).

## Security issues in software deployed by rollyourown.xyz projects

We are not the developers of the open source software deployed by rollyourown.xyz projects and cannot address security issues in deployed software ourselves. Security issues in deployed software should be reported directly to the applicable open source project. Links to the homepages of the software deployed can be found in the "Software deployed" section on each of the [project](/rollyourown/projects/) or [module](/rollyourown/project_modules/) pages.

In case of doubt, or if you have found no way to report a security issue confidentially in these cases, please contact us on [security@rollyourown.xyz](mailto:security@rollyourown.xyz).

## TODO: Security disclosure policy
