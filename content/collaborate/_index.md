Thank you for taking an interest in collaborating with us on the rollyourown.xyz project!

rollyourown.xyz is a collaborative open source project. All rollyourown.xyz [projects](/rollyourown/projects/) and [modules](/rollyourown/project_modules/) as well as the content and design of the website itself are developed in the open.

We would be delighted if you would like to contribute and there are a number of ways you can collaborate on the project.

## How to Collaborate

There are many ways to collaborate, for example:

- [Raising security-related issues](/collaborate/security_issues/)
- [Contributing bug reports, feature requests and ideas](/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/) [**TODO**]
- [Collaboration on an existing project or module](/collaborate/existing_projects_and_modules/) - e.g. to provide fixes or improvements
- [Contributing a new project or module](/collaborate/new_projects_and_modules/)
- [Contributing to rollyourown.xyz website content](/collaborate/website_content/)
- [Collaborating on the rollyourown.xyz website theme](#collaborating-on-the-website-theme)
- [Maintaining a rollyourown.xyz repository](LINK HERE)

Each of these are described in more detail on the pages linked.

Code and content of the rollyourown.xyz project is stored in our [public repositories](/collaborate/repositories/), and collaboration is organised around these. We use the Issue tracking features of [our own Gitea server](https://git.rollyourown.xyz) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz) to raise, discuss and track ideas, feature requests and bugs, and we use [git-based workflows](/collaborate/collaboration_workflows/) [**CHANGE LINK???**], to manage changes to code and content.

## Organization and membership

Following our goal of enabling self-hosting as much as possible, our repositories are maintained on [our own Gitea server](https://git.rollyourown.xyz). However, we recognise that many, many open source projects are maintained and managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and many, many developers have an account there. This makes GitHub the current de-facto standard destination for creating and collaborating on open source projects.

Therefore, we also maintain mirrors of the rollyourown.xyz [project repositories](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-projects) and the [repositories for the content and design of the rollyourown.xyz website](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-website) in [our rollyourown-xyz organisation account on GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz) so that contributors can also support us there without needing an account for our own Gitea server. One goal of our project is to lower the barriers to using open source solutions  [**LINK(S) TO MANIFESTO - LOWERING BARRIERS**], and this extends to lowering the barriers to collaborating on our project by enabling collaboration on GitHub.

An exception to this principle is for project **maintainers** and members of our organisation [**LINK TO ABOUT US**], who require a rollyourown.xyz account to have write-access to the repositories, access our non-public resources and use our communication platforms [**LINK TO DESCRIPTION OF THESE**]. If you would like to join our organisation, maintain a project or otherwise help us with managing the project, please contact us via [**LINK: WAYS TO CONTACT THE ORGANISATION**].
