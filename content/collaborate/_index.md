Thank you for taking an interest in collaborating with us on the rollyourown.xyz project!

rollyourown.xyz is a collaborative open source project. All rollyourown.xyz [projects](/rollyourown/projects/) and [modules](/rollyourown/project_modules/) as well as the content and design of the website itself are developed in the open.

We would be delighted if you would like to contribute and there are a number of ways you can collaborate on the project.

## How to collaborate

There are many ways to collaborate, for example:

- [Raising security-related issues](/collaborate/security_vulnerabilities/)
- [Contributing bug reports, feature requests and ideas](/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/)
- [Collaboration on an existing project or module](/collaborate/existing_projects_and_modules/) - e.g. to provide fixes or improvements
- [Contributing a new project or module](/collaborate/new_projects_and_modules/)
- [Contributing to rollyourown.xyz website content](/collaborate/website_content/)
- [Collaborating on the rollyourown.xyz website theme](#collaborating-on-the-website-theme)
- [Maintaining a rollyourown.xyz repository](LINK HERE)

Each of these are described in more detail on the pages linked.

Code and content of the rollyourown.xyz project is stored in our [public repositories](/collaborate/repositories/), and collaboration is organised around these. We use the Issue tracking features of [our own Gitea server](https://git.rollyourown.xyz) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz) to raise, discuss and track ideas, feature requests and bugs, and we use [git-based workflows](/collaborate/working_with_git/), to manage changes to code and content.
