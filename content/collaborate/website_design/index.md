Our website theme is managed from [our Gitea server repository](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-website/hugo-content). Therefore, collaboration on the design of our website follows a similar pattern to collaborating on the code of our projects and modules. Your collaboration on improving the design will be much appreciated.

## Proposing and making changes to our website design

If you would like to propose changes to the design of the rollyourown.xyz website, please first [submit an Issue](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-theme/issues) describing what you would like to change and why. The website maintainer can then provide feedback on the proposal in advance of you doing any work. There may be a reason why your proposal would not be accepted, or should be realised differently, so this avoids you doing work which will end up not being accepted and merged

Improvements to the rollyourown.xyz website design require changes to the theme, which typically requires knowledge of [Hugo theming](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/).

If, after discussing the change, you would like to proceed and implement it, then please fork the [GitHub mirror repository](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-theme) and submit a Pull Request. Follow the workflow described in our section on [Forking and Pull Requests](/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/).

## Licence

Please be aware that the Hugo theme for the rollyourown.xyz website is released under the open source [MIT licence](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-projects/general-feedback/src/branch/main/LICENSE). If you are not comfortable with this, then we unfortunately cannot include your contribution.
