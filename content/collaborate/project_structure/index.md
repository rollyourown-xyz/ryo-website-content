A rollyourown.xyz project has a defined, modular structure and every rollyourown.xyz project is structured in the same way. The structure is provided by the [project template repository](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-projects/ryo-project-template) and the template [can be forked to form the basis of a new rollyourown.xyz project](/LINK/TO/WORKFLOW/DESCRIPTION).

## Project directory structure

A rollyourown.xyz project is structured with the following top-level directories and scripts:

```console
project_id
|-- configuration
|   |-- ...
|-- host-setup
|   |-- ...
|-- image-build
|   |-- ...
|-- project-deployment
|   |-- ...
|-- build-images.sh
|-- deploy-project.sh
|-- get-modules.sh
|-- host-setup.sh
|-- LICENSE
|-- README.md
```

## The project_id

The `project_id` is a unique name for a rollyourown.xyz project and is also the name of the project repository on the rollyourown.xyz [Gitea server](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-projects) and on the rollyourown.xyz [Github mirror](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz).

The `project_id` is always of the form `ryo-<NAME>` where `<NAME>` usually identifies the open source software to be deployed and, if relevant, the variation of the project (for example, `ryo-nextcloud-standalone` or `ryo-gitea-with-sso`).

The `project_id` is also added to the project's [configuration template](/collaborate/project_structure/#the-configuration-directory).

## Licence and Readme

The top-level directory of a rollyourown.xyz project includes a `LICENSE` and `README.md` file:

- LICENSE: Describes the licence under which the code in the repository may be copied or used. Only [open source](https://opensource.org/osd) licences (e.g. the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licence) may be used for a rollyourown.xyz project
- README.md: Provides a high-level description of the project and how to use it

## Scripts

The top-level directory of a rollyourown.xyz project includes four scripts for the user to execute in order to [deploy the project](/rollyourown/projects/how_to_deploy/):

- get-modules.sh: Loads additional modules needed for the project
- host-setup.sh: Performs project-specific configuration of the host server
- build-images.sh: Creates an image for each of the projectâ€™s components
- deploy-project.sh: Launches project's containers and provides configuration parameters to the environment

### The `get-modules.sh` script

The `get-modules.sh` script loads additional modules needed by the project, which are retrieved from dedicated [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) repositories.

### The `host-setup.sh` script

Generic host setup and configuration has already been done by the `host-setup.sh` script in the [host server](rollyourown/project_modules/host_server/) [repository](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-host). Additional host configuration is performed for the individual project by the `host-setup.sh` script in the project's repository. This usually consists of setting up directories on the host server to provide persistent storage for the project's containers to enable component configuration and data to persist across container re-starts and replacements. Additional host setup steps may be needed, depending on the project.

The `host-setup.sh` script also calls the `host-setup.sh` scripts for any modules that are needed as part of the project.

### The `build-images.sh` script

The `build-images.sh` script calls [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to create an image for each of the project's components and upload them to the host server ready to be deployed in the `deploy-project.sh` script. A version stamp (e.g. 20210301) needs to be passed to the `build-images.sh` script, which will be used in the name of each image created and uploaded and which will be used in the `deploy-project.sh` script to launch the correct container image version and later to upgrade containers in-life.

The `build-images.sh` script also calls the `build-images.sh` scripts for any modules that need to be built as part of the project.

For each image to be built, [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) uses [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) to launch a base container on the control node (using an [ubuntu-minimal](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Minimal) cloud image), executes a component-specific [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook to provision the container with the necessary software and configuration, and then creates a container image from the fully provisioned container. Finally, packer triggers LXD to upload the container image to the remote host server ready for deployment.

### The `deploy-project.sh` script

The `deploy-project.sh` script uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and the [Terraform LXD Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terraform-lxd/lxd/) to launch the project's containers on the host machine. The version stamp provided to the `build-images.sh` script also needs to be provided to the `deploy-project.sh` script so that Terraform can identify the container images to launch.

The `deploy-project.sh` script also calls the `deploy-project.sh` scripts for any modules that need to be deployed as part of the project.

Component containers are launched as specified in the Terraform configuration. Terraform reads the current state on the host machine and makes changes to bring the host machine into the desired state. On the first execution of the `deploy-project.sh` script, no resources have been deployed to the host machine so that Terraform deploys the entire project. On a later execution, changes are only made where necessary (e.g. to upgrade a container to a newer version, built in a later build-images step).

## Directories

### The configuration directory

```console
|-- configuration
|   |-- configuration_TEMPLATE.yml
```

The `configuration` directory contains a template configuration file for the project. In addition to the `project_id`, this [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file includes any configuration parameters that the end-user of a project can set (such as the domain name or an administrator username).

### The host-setup directory

```console
|-- host-setup
|   |-- roles
|   |   |-- ansible-role
|   |   |-- ansible-role
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- ansible-playbook.yml
|   |-- ansible-playbook.yml
|   |-- ...
|   |-- main.yml
```

The `host-setup` directory contains [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks for configuring the [host server](/rollyourown/projects/host_server/) for project deployment. Generic host service configuration is done during the host setup step of project deployment, but additional configuration may be needed (creating host directories for mounting to project containers, for example).

### The image-build directory

```console
|-- image-build
|   |-- playbooks
|   |   |-- roles
|   |   |   |-- ansible-role
|   |   |   |-- ansible-role
|   |   |   |-- ...
|   |   |-- inventory.yml
|   |   |-- ansible-playbook.yml
|   |   |-- ansible-playbook.yml
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- packer-template.pkr.hcl
|   |-- packer-template.pkr.hcl
|   |-- ...
```

The `image-build` directory contains [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) templates and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks for building container images to be deployed on the host server.

### The project-deployment directory

```console
|-- project-deployment
|   |-- cloud-init
|   |   |-- cloud-init-file.yml
|   |   |-- cloud-init-file.yml
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- terraform-file.tf
|   |-- terraform-file.tf
|   |-- ...
```

The `project-deployment` directory contains the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) code to deploy the project on the host server and [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) files for providing boot-time commands to container instances, if necessary.
