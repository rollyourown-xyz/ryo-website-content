Our website content is managed from [our Gitea server repository](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-website/hugo-content). Therefore, collaboration on our website content follows a similar pattern to collaborating on the code of our projects and modules. Your collaboration on improving, translating or extending our website will be much appreciated.

## Suggesting changes

The easiest way to contribute to our website is to suggest an improvement or tell us about typos, bad phrasing etc. This can be done via the Issues in the [GitHub mirror repository for the website content](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-content).

In your issue, please provide a link to the page on which you are providing feedback or, ideally, a link to the content in [our repository](https://git.rollyourown.xyz/ryo-website/hugo-content).

## Making small changes

If you would like to submit smaller changes yourself (e.g. correcting typos, improving phrasing etc.), then this can be done by forking the [GitHub mirror repository for the website content](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-content) and submitting a Pull Request. Follow the workflow described in our section on [Forking and Pull Requests](/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/).

Your proposed changes will be reviewed and feedback given before merging takes place.

## Making larger or structural changes

If you would like to propose larger changes or suggest structural changes to the website, please first [submit an Issue](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-content/issues) describing what you would like to change and why. The website maintainer can then provide feedback on the proposal in advance of you doing any work. There may be a reason why your proposal would not be accepted, or should be realised differently, so this avoids you doing work which will end up not being accepted and merged

If, after discussing the change, you would like to proceed and implement it, then please fork the [GitHub mirror repository](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/ryo-website-hugo-content) and submit a Pull Request. Follow the workflow described in our section on [Forking and Pull Requests](/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/).

## Translating

[**TODO: Overview, thanks and a sub-page on how this is done in Hugo**. Not also that only the website is translated, not the projects themselves.]

## Format of content in the repository

Our website content is written in Markdown format [LINK HERE] in a structure that can be processed by our Hugo static site generator. For more details on this, see the [documentation for the website content structure](/collaborate/website_development/content_structure/).
