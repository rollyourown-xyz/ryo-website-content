Hello World!

## Notes and snippets as potential content

Although rollyourown.xyz projects are primarily intended for non-commercial use, to promote the use of open source projects and the sovereignty of data and applications for all, we use advanced, state-of-the-art concepts from high-availability, highly-scalable data center and service operations to provide modularity and enable automated setup of your projects. (Somewhere else: Overview and explanation of concepts used)

Examples (for each - why, how used professionally, how used in ryo?):

- Configuration as code (ansible)
- Infrastructure as code (terraform)
- Immutable infrastructrue (containers, built with packer)
- Service discovery (?)
- etc.
