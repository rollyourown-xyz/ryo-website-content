Use rollyourown.xyz projects to easily roll your own free, de-centralised and federated services. Each project contains automation code to configure, build, deploy, maintain, back up and restore services based on open source software.

Select a project from the menu on the left to learn about:

* The software installed by the project
* Where to find the repositories containin the project code
* How to use the project

When you have chosen a project to deploy, learn the steps to set up a [control node](/rollyourown/how_to_use/control_node/) and [host server](/rollyourown/how_to_use/host_server/) to run the project and [how to deploy](/rollyourown/how_to_use/deploy/) it.

For an example of how to use rollyourown.xyz projects to provide different services, see how we use our own projects to run [our own infrastructure](/about/our_infrastructure/).
