We have upgraded LXD in rollyourown control node and rollyourown host server automation to the [latest LTS version (v5.0)](https://ubuntu.com/blog/lxd-5-0-lts-is-now-available), with support until June 2027.

rollyourown users should upgrade their control node and host servers at their convenience, using the [`local-setup.sh`](/rollyourown/how_to_use/control_node/#control-node-maintenance) and [`host-upgrade.sh`](/rollyourown/how_to_use/host_server/#host-server-maintenance) scripts, respectively.
